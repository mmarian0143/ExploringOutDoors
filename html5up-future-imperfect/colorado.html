								<p> Colorado is one of the most beautiful states I've been to so far. Every corner you turn, there's a scenery to see. I also locate in Arizona, so being able to wake up to a fifty-degree weather in the middle of a summer was a bonus for me. This hike was located in a glacial basin in southwest Colorado. There are three different lakes there, but I chose to hike to the lowest one. And I'll be honest, it was a cold and difficult 6.9-mile hike, but it was so worth it. Not only was the destination breathtaking, but so were the scenery before even reaching the lake. One of the worst decisions I made when hiking this was not bringing along a snack, so don't make that same mistake. Even if you have just a few almonds or peanuts...bring them along so you won't get hangry on the way. Most of the hike was steep so I wouldn't recommend bringing children along. In the future, I would like to hike the whole mountain which is about 13 miles with an elevation gain of 5,501 ft... but I would also bring along my camping gear and camp out at each lake before continuing to the next. That way I have time to enjoy the views while also hiking one of the tallest peaks in the state of Colorado.    </p>
								<p> The best thing to do when you visit this state is to rent a car and travel all around the state that way you don't miss out on any breathtaking looks. Because taking a plane to travel around it would only allow you to see not even half of it's beauty.  </p>
